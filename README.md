# heliostat-solar-tracking
Final Year Project on Designing, Testing and Building a Heliostat
Solar power plant is the widest market prospect type in large-scale solar power plants during the next decades. Heliostats are the most important components in this system. To solve the problems in sun-tracking, concentrating control and low dynamic precision of the heliostat, the nonlinear kinematic model of a heliostat is developed based on analysis of the two-axis rotation sun-tracking mechanism and property. The effectiveness of proposed concepts, calibration and control theory of a heliostat was verified through theoretical simulation and experimental researches.
